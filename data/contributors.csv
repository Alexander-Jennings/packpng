All seeds are a number, if letters are entered into the seed box, Java's hashCode() function is used to turn it into a number.  Seeds do not use up much disk space (stored as a long integer, meaning just 8 bytes per world) because only a seed that has been chosen for a world is stored; not all 18 quintillion. When a seed is needed for world generation, a random one is generated from the system clock (or entered manually by the user) and is then stored and used to generate the world. "

Also, I believe I was the first person to bring up the idea of determining the time of day using the colour of the sky: ""Can we find the time of day via the colour tint of the sky by any chance?"". This later on prompted a discussion into using the sky colour to confirm the biome that pack.png was taken in. I went as far as to take a guess as to what the biome could be based on the sky colour: ""I believe the biome that pack.png was taken in was a ""shrubland"" biome according to an almost identical sky colour. This biome was added in a1.2.0 I believe""."
